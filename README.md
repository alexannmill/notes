<!-- Here are all 5 rules reviewed below:

Give your functions precise verb/action based names
Use camelCasedNames (like this one)
Properly indent the function code
Functions should focus on a single task: returning a value or causing a side effect. Break your function into additional smaller functions if you find it doing two or more things
One single task could be to compute and return a value (eg: zeroPad)
Another single task could be to perform a side effect such as logging a message to the screen (eg: printFarmInventory)
Data needed by Functions should be passed in as parameters/arguments (i.e. local scope) instead of being accessed directly -->
